# HandwrittenNumbers_Recognition_ML
This Repository contains a learning algorithm that learns how to read handwritten number in matlab/octave for a linear regression cost function implementation and neural network implementation for forward propogation. This project is part of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course from Stanford University. Each file contains comments and explanations of the implementation. Something to note, weights for the neural network have already been assigned and for the handwritten numbers being read, we transformed these images from a jpeg image format into pixel matrices in octave This makes it so our code is much easier to implement.

Additional Note: The files where all the training data is are too large to be viewed on github, so they will not be found in this repository.
